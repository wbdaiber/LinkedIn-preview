4. Visual alerts appear when approaching/exceeding limits
5. User reviews message in LinkedIn preview simulation
6. User copies final message to LinkedIn

### Alternative Flow (History-Based)
1. User opens tool and views recent messages from session
2. User selects a previous message to modify
3. User edits message with real-time feedback
4. Character limits are monitored during editing
5. User copies updated message
